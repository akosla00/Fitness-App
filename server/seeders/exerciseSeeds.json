The first phase is when you come forward on the rower. Your knees are bent and against your chest. Your upper body is leaning slightly forward while still maintaining good posture.Next, push against the foot pedals and extend your legs while bringing your hands to your upper abdominal area, squeezing your shoulders back as you do so. To avoid straining your back, use primarily your leg and hip muscles. The recovery phase simply involves straightening your arms, bending the knees, and bringing your body forward again as you transition back into the first phase.",

A 150 lb person will burn on average 387 calories in 30 minutes, compared to more than 450-700 calories running.

A 150 lb person can burn over 200 calories for 30 minutes walking uphill, compared to 175 on a flat surface. If running the trail, a 150 lb person can burn well over 500 calories in 30 minutes."
