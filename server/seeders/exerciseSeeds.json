Dip under the bar to put it behind the neck across the top of the back, and grip the bar with the hands wider than shoulder-width apart. Lift the chest up and squeeze the shoulder blades together to keep the straight back throughout the entire movement. Stand up to bring the bar off the rack and step backwards, then place the feet so that they are a little wider than shoulder-width apart. Sit back into hips and keep the back straight and the chest up, squatting down so the hips are below the knees. From the bottom of the squat, press feet into the ground and push hips forward to return to the top of the standing position.",

Dip under the bar to lift it up and rest it on the front of shoulders, then step back away from the rack. Place the feet hip-width apart, and bend at the knees while keeping the back straight. Quickly press the feet into the floor and snap the hips forward while pushing the weight directly overhead with the elbows facing away from the body. Slowly lower the barbell to the shoulders and repeat. The power for moving the weight should come from the hips and transfer through the shoulders and arms.",
